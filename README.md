# React Trivia Question App Lab

## Trivia Questions App

In this lab you're given starter code for a trivia question app. The app currently displays a question and multiple choice answers. When the user clicks on an answer they will be informed if the answer was correct or wrong.

At the moment the app only shows one question and there is no way to get more questions

We would like it to work as it does in this solution: https://cunytechprep.github.io/lab-react-trivia-solution/

### Tasks

- [X] Add an event handler for the `Next Question` button
- [X] Fetch a new question for the app when the user clicks the `Next Question` button
  - use this API URL: `https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=1&category=9&type=multiple`
  - the API will return a random question with each call
